## Build a Tic Tac Toe Game

### Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/.

- User Story: I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

- User Story: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

- User Story: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
